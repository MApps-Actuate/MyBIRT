MyBIRT
======

This concept application demonstrates how the various Actuate APIs can be used to create a custom report designer interface.
Due to the conceptual nature of this app, not all features are fully functional and it currently only works in a Chrome browser.
Support is limited and the techniques used may not be the best practice.  This app is only to demonstrate a concept, and is not a "how-to" guide.

Installation:

A. Publish to the iHub:
	1. myBIRT folder and all it's contents to the root of the volume.
	2. Resources\myBIRT folder and all its contents to the Resources folder.
